# VelibAndCats
![Example](Example.png)
- **VelibAndCats** is a script that sends through Twitter Direct Message with **infos about VÃ©lib'** docking points (*stations*) along with **a cat fact**.
- It uses the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/), the [Velib Metropole API](https://www.velib-metropole.fr/donnees-open-data-gbfs-du-service-velib-metropole), the [python-twitter library](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io) and a `cron` task running on a NAS server.
- Depending on the time (morning vs. evening):
  - in the morning the state of *home stations* is displayed first, then a *cat fact*, then the state of *day/work stations*
  - in the evening that order is reversed
- can be personnalized by adding users and their lists of stations of interest
- can be run as a scheduled task on a NAS
